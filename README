This creates a TUN/TAP device for your troublesome Linux distro
when you can't get your VPN or Virtualization drivers to do
it automatically.

I wrote this to be a direct "drop-in" replacement for the Gentoo 
Openvpn init script's tun/tap module checking. This script has better
error handling and will actually attempt to create the device if
one does not already exist before reporting a failure. For those
with kernels that support virtualization of some kind, the tun
module is often not loaded on boot (even though it is supposed to)
so this script should insert and create the module correctly.

You can optionally paste it in your init script to run before the
original script's tun handling, it will not interfere with any
code that is already there. Just make sure to paste it after the
"dependencies" section and before the "tun/tap" section.

TODO:
-Check for kernel TUN modular or statically linked driver availability using /proc.
	Init script already has a basic way of doing this.
